Nathaniel Text:

(Normal Voice)

My friends, my people, my flock; 
I have had a vision – a vast fiery orb, floating in an endless void, and us, so small, so fragile, and falling, falling into the flames.”

(Singing Voice)

Your soul is connected to the world you’re in  
You’re dragging it down with the weight of your sin  
Surrounded by temptations and you just give in  
We’re falling into the flames

Of that fire! That fire! That hellfire!  
Your brow becomes slick as you perspire  
You think you’re thirsty now wait till it gets drier  
And you feel the heat of the flames!

Of that fire! That fire! That hellfire!  
Your sick and sinful lives will build a funeral pyre  
Your perversions scar the world here, son, they’re gonna fry her  
And we all fall into the flames!

(Normal Voice)

Oh, I have seen damnation my brothers
I have felt its searing heat within my very bones!
But there is a way we may be saved
'Oh tell us father Nathaniel, tell us!'
I hear you cry
'Is it piety, is it purity, is it virtue?'
No! The only way to save us now is the holy grail itself!

Ha ha ha

(Singing Voice)

Well that orb of damnation makes the sun seem pale  
You’re quite correct to quiver you are right to quail  
The only way to save us is to find that grail  
We all fall into the flames

Of that fire! That fire! That hellfire!  
Your skin starts to sizzle as you expire  
You claim to be virtuous, but you’re a liar  
And you'll feel the heat of the flame

Hellfire!  
Hellfire!  
Hellfire!  
Hellfire!

That fire! That fire! That hellfire!  
At the heart of the inferno that will never tire  
I have seen the end is nigh, and damnation’s nigher  
And we all fall into the flames!
