- Conversation between Nathaniel and a scared Farmer.
***

Nathaniel is a 37 year old human male with unwashed long black hair and yellow eyes. 
He grew up in a small farming village called Fremin near the continents east coast, where he spent the first 21 years of his life.
The receiver of "holy visions", as he calls them, ever since an accident involving a thunderstorm on the day of his 21st birthday, Nathaniel sees himself as Gods chosen messiah, the savior of the world from the heretical dragons as well as all those who would aspire, in their hubris, to surpass God.
Nathaniel spent the last 16 years on the road, running from the authorities, or as he calls them "the Devils soldiers". Moving from one city to the next, sometimes spending days or weeks at a time locked up in jail cells or insane asylums, before he inevitably breaks out and returns to his work.
While all see the obvious insanity behind his eyes, it cannot be disputed that Nathaniel is in fact being empowered by some kind powerful force pushing him beyond the bounds of the ordinary.

## Backstory:

### Before the Accident:
Nathaniel was born and raised in the village of Fremin located on the east coast.
As a child, he had many friends due to his sense of humor and outgoing personality.
His parents owned a farm just outside the village, where they grew many different kinds of vegetables. They even had a small collection of livestock, making them some of there wealthier farmers in the area, though nothing akin to the nobility of the larger cities.
After the untimely and mysterious death of his mother, his father fell to alcoholism, growing more reclusive, but never abusive. Nathaniel pitied him and his sadness.

Nathaniel and some of his friends would eventually completely take over the management of the farm, working the land together, sharing the burdens an the profits equally.
And so it was for many years, until one day, just as his 21st year of life began everything changed.

### The Accident:
The day began like any other, with a communal breakfast, a checkup on Nathaniel's father and some minor managerial work. 
But when the time came to harvest that season's crops the day worsened.
A sudden thunderstorm had made fieldwork almost impossible. Not only that, the storm also threatened to damage many of the fences and buildings around the farm.
And so, in a fit of rage, Nathaniel reached for his shovel and went outside, swinging it wildly, cursing the Dragon Gods for the storm.
And then it struck. 300 million volts of energy shot right through his body as the lightning impacted into the shovel raised high into the air. 
It was over quick. The shovel lay shattered into a thousand pieces strewn across half the farm.
And Nathaniel lay on the ground, rain falling on his face and broken body. His heart no longer beating.
The others rushed towards him, carrying him into the farmhouse as quick as they could.
They gave him herbs and whatever potions they still head, constantly trying to talk to him.
Meanwhile Nathaniel was surrounded only by blackness. A never ending void that stretched on into eternity.
Then, suddenly, a light and... a person? 
Words of reassurance. Telling him that he will not die. That he still has things to live for. That he must help them... save... a farm? A land? 
What could the voice mean? What is this? Is this... God?
It must be. And he must help God save... a farm? No. The farm is a metaphor. Surely God means the world! He must help God save the world! He has been chosen! Messiah!
And so he draws breath again. Waking in an unfamiliar farmhouse. Surrounded by unfamiliar people.

### After the Accident:
The strangers tried to talk to him, keep him resting in the farmhouse, said that he must recover, that the memories will return with time, that he will be alright again.
But Nathaniel knew that this was but his first test. These people were good. Simple, gentle folks. And he needed to leave them. Step out into the world to fulfill his destiny.
Thus, one night, he gathered his things and left.

For the next years, Nathaniel would roam the countryside, learning, preaching, growing stronger.
He had learned of the false dragon gods, those who would usurp God's status. 
He learned of their followers, those devil soldiers that others called "guards" and of their wicked inventions, like 'lemons' that threatened the divine order of the world. 

Unbeknownst to Nathaniel, his adventures not only drew the attention of the authorities, but also that of more hellish creatures.
The occupants of the underworld had caught wind of the mad prophets antics. And they were amused. Ultimately they decided to bestow upon Nathaniel a part of their powers, if not to gain tribute, then to gain a break from their boring and monotonous lives. After all, ever since the dragons had begun their watch over the continent, life had grown oh so uninteresting.
It would not take long for Nathaniel to become a staple of the underworlds culture, with uncountable demons, imps and the like tuning in daily to see his adventures. 
Their scrying sphere always out of his view.

But even this would grow monotonous over time, and so the showrunners would begin to make plans for more and more interesting situations, should Nathaniel's ratings ever fall.

In the meantime, Nathaniel would continue to roam the country, using his new "holy" powers to spread the word of God wherever he could.
Town squares, cathedrals, parties thrown by the upper nobility, it mattered not to him.
Though it often mattered to the devils soldiers known as guards.
And so Nathaniel spent many months of his life thrown into jail cells and asylums. 
There he met many other interesting people that helped him hone his skills of escaping any tricky situation with time.
