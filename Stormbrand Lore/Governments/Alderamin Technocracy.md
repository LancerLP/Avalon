*** 
The Alderamin Technocracy is the ruling body of the [[Alderamin|Alderamin System]], which lies at the very edge of human space.
Founded in [[24th Century|2337]] by the descendants of the original occupants of [[Project ARK|ARK Janus]], 
the Alderamin Technocracy holds ethical scientific progress in high regards, operating under the motto "Compassion Guides Progress". Their government operates under an advanced type of oligarchy, where leaders of every aspect of society are chosen through yearly standardised tests devised by Sentient Artificial Intelligence Network Technology (SAINTs). 
These leaders, of which there exist roughly 500 at any given time, then oversee the allocation of resources, policy and manpower.  
[[Artificial Intelligence]] enjoys a full set of rights, making them equal to their human counterparts in legal proceedings.
