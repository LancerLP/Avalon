>"Let it be known that humanity, once divided, has now embraced itself wholly. To stride into the future. United."
>-Nathan Heathrow, First Prime Minister of the United Colonies

***
The United Colonies is the primary governing body of [humanity](Humanity.md) in the the [[25th Century|25th century]].
Founded in [[23rd Century|2364]], after the end of the [[Unification Wars]], by representatives from the [[Alliance of Colonies]] and the [[United Nations of Earth]], the United Colonies primary focus lies in the protection of [[List of Human Settlements|human settlements]] from external as well as internal threats. 
In this goal, the United Colonies allows its member systems a large degree of freedom, acting less like a government and more like an intergovernmental organization.
The headquarters of the United Colonies is located on Odyssey in the [[Alpha Centauri]] system.
The current Prime Minister of the United Colonies is Amelia Theodore Bernstein.

# Structure
### Parliament
The United Colonies Parliament consists of two main branches, the Senate and the Representative which share an equal amount of power to ensure that neither side can overpower the other in important matters.
The Senate is made up of officials that have been directly elected by the populace in a general election that takes place every three years. The final number of Senators is always equal to the number of Representatives, with the number of Representatives usually acting as the "fixed" number.
The Representative consists of ambassadors and politicians sent by the local governments of each member system of the United Colonies. Each system has the ability to send one Representative.
Representatives and Senators both have a maximum term limit of 12 years, though most often take an advisory position after their term limit has been reached.
A local government can at any time recall and reassign one of their representatives.
Senators on the other hand can only be removed through a majority vote in parliament.
### Supreme-Court
The Supreme Court of the United Colonies is the highest judicial institution recognized by all member systems of the United Colonies. All laws and resolutions proposed by the parliament must be reviewed and signed by the Supreme Court before they can go into effect.
The Supreme Court consists of ten High Judges who are voted in by the Council every 20 years, though votes can happen more often if a High Judge resigns or dies. A special exception can be made if a judge is found guilty of criminal behaviour, though the article dealing with this potentiality has only been invoked once before in the entire history of the United Colonies.  
The headquarters of the Supreme Court are located on Odyssey in the Alpha Centauri system.
### Military
Three major military branches exist within the United Colonies. 
The Navy, the Marines, the Army and the Air Force.
The United Colonies Naval Corp (UCNC), under the command of NAV-COM, is responsible for all spaceborne, as well as maritime, vessels and their dedicated crews under the flag of the United Colonies.
As the primary space agency of the United Colonies, the Navy also employs a wide variety of other professions, like science and engineering, outside of their core military personnel.
However, all members of a vessels bridge crew must have completed both their military as well as their command level training.
In war times the Navy may conscript civilian vessels into their ranks, though such a decision has to be made with proper cause.
The United Colonies Marine Corp (UCMC) makes up the bulk of the United Colonies expeditionary forces. Trained for rapid response situations in space and on land, Marines are shock troops meant to rapidly assault and neutralize any hostiles. They most often serve on naval vessels leading to a close bond between the two branches.
The United Colonies Army Corp (UCAC) is the least prestigious, yet most fundamental branch of the United Colonies Military. Usually stationed on permanent deployments like planets and space stations, the Army most often assists local military and militia forces by maintaining and manning more intricate installations that go beyond the capabilities of any single government.
The United Colonies Air Force (UCAF) is the largest of the specialized branches. Its members serve alongside every other branch of the military, though each member is usually assigned to either space, or in-atmosphere deployments early on in their careers. However, some members that show exceptional skill early on in their career are assigned to a mixed deployment.
More specialized branches exists among all branches of the military, though their exact operations and mission statements are usually of a more clandestine nature.
All branches of the military are ultimately under the jurisdiction of MIL-COM which has its headquarters on the moon of Titan in the Sol System.
### Policing
The Interplanetary Police Bureau (IPB) exists as an interplanetary, trans-national peacekeeping force. Their founding can be traced back to the years just after the fall of the [[Dark Star]] Group, envisioned as a future counter to corruption and crime across the United Colonies.
The IPB recruits its members from local peacekeeping forces, militias and security contractors.
Members of the IPB enjoy a large amount of freedom when it comes to the execution of their investigations, being subject to little oversight while they are working.
They are still beholden to UC laws, though they are able to bend it in special situations.
The IPB has no centralized headquarters, instead choosing to operate out of multiple mobile capital ships, spread across UC territory. 
Each member of the IPB has access to a small personal spacecraft, though most seldom make use of it, preferring the greater degree of subtlety and discretion afforded by public transportation and commercial vessels.   
### The-Council
The United Colonies Council is the true ruling body of the United Colonies. The Council is made up of five members selected from the most important institutions across UC space.
Namely, the Senate, the Representative, the Supreme Court, the Military and the Industrial.
Both the Senate and the Representative select their Councillor on a democratic basis by having their members vote in an election which is usually held shortly after the general election, in the Senates case, or once every 4 years in the Representatives case.
The high judges of the Supreme Court send one of their members to be a Councillor, though the position is considered honorary in nature, as the Supreme Courts small size allows it to effectively vote on council matters as a whole.
The position of Councillor given to the Military is usually awarded to the highest ranking member of MIL-COM, though some exceptions have been made throughout the history of the UC.
Lastly, the Industrial, is a special position which is afforded to the most influential CEO of the UCs private sector.
The position is considered controversial with many former holders of the title having been accused and convicted on the count of corruption by the the IPB.
While the council itself has little additional power compared to the organisations they embody, their influence stems from the additional level of cross-institution communication and their direct access to the Prime Minister of the United Colonies at all times. All this gives them the power to effectively shift the nations focus on certain topics to a large degree.
