Many proportions in nature are given by the golden section.

Aesthetic rules are grounded in optimality.

Ability to see abstract things as shapes seems to be a human thing.
- Unknown extent in animals.

***
How/Why do we understand line drawings?
Retina:
- Contrast enhancement
	- Edges help detect objects
	- Depth perception
- Edges of objects used to identify them
***
There is always an optimal way of visual information encoding and transfer.
- Degree of abstraction

Always understand your code. Explaining it is a possible question later on.
Oral examination will include code presentation.

### History of Illustrative Computer Graphics

Loose representation of a scene helps people understand that a plan is not fixed
- They are more likely to change things and interact with it.

##### 2D
Screening technique:
- Covert grayscale into black and white by dividing pixels
- Needed in newspapers and printing technology
- Artistic screening

Drawing strokes

Painterly Rendering:
- Compute colour gradient
- Move perpendicular to it

Stippling:
- Use many dots to create an image
- Size and regularity of dots impacts the texture of an object

"We can describe basic artistic techniques by mathematical means."

Mosaics:
- Dots instead of tiles.
	- Orientation important
	- Edge avoidance

##### 2.5D

##### 3D
Silhouette lines:
- suggestive contours are silhouette lines that would appear if the POV changes slightly
