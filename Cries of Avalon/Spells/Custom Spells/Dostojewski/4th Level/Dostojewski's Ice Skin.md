This spell creates a thick carapace of ice around a willing creature. The creature gains 15 temporary hit points. Until the spell ends the creature has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as resistance against fire damage. 

The spell can be prematurely ended by breaking the casters concentration or when the target looses all temporary hitpoints.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, a creature affected by this spell gains an additional 10 temporary hit points per level.
