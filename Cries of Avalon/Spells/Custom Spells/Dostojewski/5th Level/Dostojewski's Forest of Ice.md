A forest made entirely out of ice appears around the caster, complete with trees, grass, and animal sculptures.
The air is frigid and shards of ice are as sharp as razors.
Any creature in the forest's space when you cast this spell or starts its turn in it must make a constitution saving throw or take 3d6 cold damage.
The area of the forest is considered difficult terrain.
At the start of the casters turn, the forest will regenerate any damage it has sustained, returning to a pristine condition.
A creature killed in the forest becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

When the spell ends, the forest disappears.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage the forest deals to its occupants increases by 1d6 and the radius of the forest increases by 10 ft. per level.
