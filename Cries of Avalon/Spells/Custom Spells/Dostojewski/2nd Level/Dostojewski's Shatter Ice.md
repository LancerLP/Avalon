You shatter every object made out of ice in a 30ft. radius around yourself. Any object made out of ice that weighs at least 5 pounds will be shattered and throw sharp shards in a 10 ft. radius around itself. Any creature caught in the radius of one of those objects must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save the creature takes 1d8 slashing and 2d6 cold damage. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage. If a creature is caught in the range of multiple objects it rolls a sperate save for each object.

Any object made out of ice caught in the effect of this spell breaks.
