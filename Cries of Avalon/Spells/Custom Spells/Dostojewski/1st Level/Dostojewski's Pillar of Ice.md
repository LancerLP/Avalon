A pillar of ice springs forth from a point within 60 ft. of the caster. Any creature in the pillar's space when you cast this spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed safe, the creature takes 3d6 cold damage and is restrained by the pillar. A creature restrained by the pillar can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the pillar disappears.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create one additional pillar per level at a location of your choosing within range.
