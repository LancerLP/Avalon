An upper chest high wall of ice shoots out of the ground in front and to the sides of the caster, providing them with three-quarters cover. 
Any creature standing on a spot the barrier appears in must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 cold damage and they are pushed 5 ft. backwards. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5ft. backwards.
The wall of ice created by this spell remains where it is even after the spell ends.
