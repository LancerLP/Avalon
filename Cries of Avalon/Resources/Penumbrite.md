Penumbrite is a glowing blue-/purplish crystal, found on the moon of Ilos. 
Its crystal structure is capable of storing large quantities of raw magical power, making it a highly sought after resource in the creation of spell foci and powerful magical items.
Due to its highly complex nature that goes beyond anything else found in nature, many suspect that the crystal is not of natural origin at all, but instead a type of artificial mineral created by the Ancients.
Penumbrite radiates a slight amount of magic. Prolonged exposure to this radiation causes mutations in non-mages.
