***

This session will tell the story the parties first meeting with the member of the [[Emperors Chosen]] called [[Dostojewski]], their introduction to Dr. [[Julian Laplace]], and their eventual uncovering of the secret below [[Safehouse Songbird]].

If it comes to a fight between Dostojewski and the party, he will try to capture them alive, or if they get away, track them.

***
## Act 1: The Meeting

We pick up where we left off, with the stranger emerging from out of the forest, his hands raised.
Tycho is scouting the area and not currently there.

The stranger will claim the following things if asked:
- He is a ranger, only out here because he heard the sounds of fighting.
- He only just arrived here.
- He introduces himself as Theodore Ivanov

Things the party can pick up on:
- (Perception 12) The mans accent doesn't sound local.
	- (14) The accent sounds closer to an Ecumene accent.
	- (16) Some very slight hints of an Acheron accent lay beneath them.
- (Investigation 14) The man is armed. Looks like he has a rapier.
- (Touch) The man feels somewhat cold to the touch.
- (Insight 16) Something seems off about the mans demeanor. Feels uncanny.

If the party figures out his true identity or attacks him out of suspicion he will immediately fight back with his full force.

If the party does not attack him, he will help them find the doctor.

## Act 2: The Good Doctor

The party finds the doctor among some wounded, some of them seem to be in critical condition.
Initially, the doctor will assume that the party is not friendly, but he knows that there is nothing he can do to fend them off if it came to that.

The doctor has the following information:
- His name is Julian Laplace.
- Two people here are in critical condition, three are wounded.
- He does not know if anyone else survived.
- He did not see the attacker.
	- He heard the cars screech to a halt.
	- Some fighters disembarked.
	- Screams and the sound of ice shards could be heard.
	- Everyone made a run for it while some people provided cover.

If the party does not attack Dostojewski, he will help them get the wounded to the parties car.
If they confront him with any suspicions that he can't talk himself out of, he will casually threaten all the survivors.

## Act 3: Logistics

The party returns to Songbird with the Doctor, his entourage (and if they have not attacked him, Dostojewski), it looks like most of the people have moved inside by now, only a few fighters are outside to guard the place. 

Inside, Fenrir and Elsie wait in a hastily constructed command center. Upon the parties return they will congratulate the party on a job well done.

They will then involve the party in an argument they had about their strategy going forward.

Fenrir is in favor of an aggressive campaign of hit and run tactics, focusing hitting high value targets, while evading stronger forces.

Elsie is in favor of a cautious approach that will involve them laying low, building up networks and preparing for a long, drawn out conflict.

Neither side is willing to compromise on this, but both have decided that arbitration by the party will be acceptable no matter what they decide.

In the end, they inform the party that Ward has regained consciousness and that it might be a nice gesture to visit him in the future.

If the party talks to Ward, he will tell them about how after what happened in the prison he no longer sees himself fit to go out there, instead, he has opted to stay at Songbird and create some communal spaces.
He will ask the party if they would rather see a bar or something more homely added to Songbird.

## Act 4: Deamons

During the night, while the party is in their quarters, they are awoken by or notice a number of malfunctioning electronics.
(Intelligence 15) Some of the screens are turning on and off again rapidly... it almost looks like... morse code!?

Light across the compound keep flashing and emergency directions lead the party towards the previously locked door.
Once there they will meet Fenrir, Elsie, Tycho, Julian, and if still there, Dostojevski in front of it.
Elsie advises caution, while Fenrir will say that if this continues, all the power surges will eventually give away their position to any satellites in orbit.

Upon breaching the door by whatever means, they will see that the facility is much larger than anticipated. At the back of the room they will find an elevator which is too big for all of them to enter. The party will descend on their own eventually arriving at one of the lower levels.
The lights are already on, guiding them through a corridor to a single room.

Within the room exist about a dozen pods, arranged in a circular shape around the center pillar.
One of the pods is missing from the circle and is instead placed up against the pillar, a figure lies before it.

{Potential End of Session}

Information the party can gather:
- Most of the pods have skeletons inside them.
- The central pod is still active and a person is kept within it.
- The pod is connected to the figure lying next to it.
- The figure has exposed metal parts underneath human like skin.
- Disconnecting the figure from the pod will most likely result in the death of the occupant.
- The pods occupant is named "Lieutenant Asher Dene"
- He appears to be in critical condition, only the cryo-pod is keeping him alive.
