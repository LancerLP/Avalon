By far the most controversial figure of the group, Cassidy Navarro is one of the most dangerous people in the system. Not due to any physical or magical prowess, but due to his sheer determination.
Wherever he goes, he carries with him a reputation of death and defiance. 
To some, he is a hero, to others a terrorist. But to the resistance, he is an asset of unprecedented scale.

## Morals/Beliefs

A man of action. No deed to terrible, no price too high. Not if it helps him accomplish his goal of seeing the Imperium shattered and broken.

Legitimacy through violence. Cassidy uses violence to attain his goals.

## Foil

Dr. Armstrong.
