Born on [[Planet; Acheron|Acheron]] to a family of sub-surface miners, Theodore Ivanov would have lived the life of a nobody, were it not for the untimely death of his parents at the age of 9.
From that point onward, Theodore would wander the streets of [[Demeter City]] as a thief and criminal. For four years he would wander the city, stealing just to survive until one fateful day, his thievery would have him stand in front of [Emperor Dracon Moore] himself, knife in hand, drawn to strike.
While the attempted robbery was quickly ended by the [[Emperor's Blade]], the boldness and tenacity of the young Theodore would greatly impress the Emperor.
Following the decision to adopt Theodore, the Emperor would raise his adoptive son in secret, away from the eyes of the public. Whether this was to spare his son from the pains of the public life which he had to endure, or to keep his own power prime and center, is something none except for the Emperor know.
Under the Emperors guidance, Theodore would begin to study magic, becoming a powerful mage in his own right. His studies with his adoptive mother, [[Emperor's Blade|Serra]], would have the young man become a proficient sword-fighter and a decent shot.
At the age of 22, Theodore, faced with a stagnation in his magical studies and desperate to live up to his fathers expectations, opted to join his fathers [[Project Amrita|Amrita]] project. 
Theodore would undergo the grueling physical and mental strain associated with the project before eventually being hailed as the third successful participant of the project.
Soon after, he would manifest special magical powers associated with the manipulation of temperature. In a controlled environment, given enough time, he was able to cool an object to almost 0Â°K, making him the most proficient Ice-Mage in the history of the Imperium.
