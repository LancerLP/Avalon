*A highly acidic atmosphere, scorching temperatures and seas of burning boric acid make up this planets unique environment.  
While such conditions would usually deter anyone from taking up the burden of colonizing this world, the planets rich deposits of rare gases and metals have resulted in a strong Imperial presence on the surface.  
Large underground cities are connected to orbital platforms through space elevators, while environmentally sealed slave camps dot the planets survace.  
Ruins left by the Avalonian Federation can still be found all over the surface, though it is only a matter of time until the harsh weather and strong acid wipes out any remaining traces of them.**
