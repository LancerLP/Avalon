You find yourself in the town of Flemming, sat right on the border between the nations of Silrund and Nelfmire. The morning air feels cold in your nostrils and the sun, rising over the horizon is blindingly bright. You all have arrived here yesterday for a variety of reasons, but for all of you, this town merely represents a pitstop on your real journey. Coincidentally, you all arrive at the border gate at the same time. 
## Opening: The Gate
---
##### GM Note:

##### Scene Cinematic:

But shouting can already be heard long before you arrive there.
"What do you mean the border is closed!?", screams the Half Orc at the tip of the line, "Do you have any idea what will happen when my employer finds out that his goods are being held up in some run down piece of shit village!? Idiots!". The Half Orc stomps away angrily, his feet leaving heavy imprints in the soft snow, leaving you next in line.
##### Location:

Where:
Flemming, Silrund. Border between Nelfmire and Silrund. Gate to Nelfmire.

Facts:

***

***

Persuasion/Intimidation/Deception: Convince Gyle to let you pass. Lyla will move in to prevent this.
	- If handled without violence: Gyle will suggest the party stays at a tavern for a couple more nights. He's sure that everything will be taken care of by then.

## Scene: The Tavern
---
##### GM Note:

##### Scene Cinematic:

As you open the door to the tavern you are all immediately hit by a gust of warm air that carries the scent of cooked meats and vegetables. A slight hint of alcohol also emerges soon after, though it is less noticeable than you had anticipated.
A voice from the counter beckons you inside, asking you to kindly close the door behind you to not let the warmth escape.
The tavern is densely packed with people and it is easy to see that the staff seems a little overwhelmed by the amount of guests.
##### Location:

Where:
Hearthfire Inn, Flemming, Silrund

Facts:
1) There is an ice drake skull mounted above the bar.
2) The middle of the room contains a large fire pit.
3) There are rooms for rent on the second floor.

Senses:
	Smell:
		Smoked meats hanging above the fireplace.
		Alcohol being consumed by the people around the tables.
		Freshly prepared dishes in the kitchen.
	Sight:
		Ice Drake Skull mounted on the wall.
		Overwhelmed waiters.
		The Inn seems very overcrowded.
	Sound:
		Crackling wood from the fireplace.
		A large number of simultaneous conversations makes it difficult to understand things.
	Touch:
		Rough wood counter.

##### Stakes:

The loud conversations make it hard to understand things. (Disadvantage on Perception or Investigation checks that rely on hearing)
##### Clues:
The amount of people and what they talk about make it seem like the gate has been closed for the last couple of days.
##### Dialog:
***
Thilde: "Ah, more travellers unable to pass the gates? Feel free to take a seat wherever you can find one."
***
Mullinae: "Think of this realm as a tavern and of the Inbetween as the outside. Here you are safe, warm and fed, outside you go hungry and will most likely freeze to death. Think of a rift as a cracked window."

##### Skill Checks:
Perception: Try to listen in on conversations.
Nature: Find out more about the Ice Drake head.
##### Reveal:
Mullinae: The border is in part closed because of the rift.
## Scene: The Guard Captains Office
---
##### GM Note:

##### Scene Cinematic: 

Your footsteps echo on the worn stone floor of the keep. A cool wind emanates from the open windows to your right, while flickering fires off iron braziers dotted along the hallway provide warmth from the left. Two guards escort you to the end of the corridor, where two large wooden doors await. 

As the doors creek open, you are met by a well furnished and comfortable office.
Dead centre of the room you see a large wooden desk, surrounded by chairs on your side and a comfortable looking seat on the other. The air smells faintly of scented candlewax.
Opposite to the door, a set of large windows overlook the town and the mountain pass beyond it.
A figure, clad in yellow and green stands there, she appears to be armed and armoured, at least as much as her current position allows her. As she turns around, you all gaze upon the lightly scarred face of the Guard Captain.
##### Location:

Where:
Guard Captain's Office, The Keep, Flemming, Silrund

Facts:
1) Large number of weapons and armour dotted around the room.
2) There is a golden crest depicting two wings and a sword, located in a trophy case on puffy blue fabric.
3) The room looks like it would offer a perfect place to defend.

Senses:
Smell:
	Scented candlewax, smelling faintly of lavender.
Sight:
	A case filled with different medals. 
	A sturdy looking sword and suit of armour
Sound:
	A crackling fireplace
Touch:
	Leather gloves of the guard captain.
