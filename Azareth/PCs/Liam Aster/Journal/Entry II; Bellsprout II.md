We all have a story to tell. Tehwo, Aster, Keshera, me, every person in this city, every missing victim and their kidnapper. All of us, all of them, are people with lives, motivations, loved ones.  
I find it important to remind myself of this from time to time. Especially now that I finally have a lead to follow again, as grim as it may be.  
It would be too easy to slip into the belief that our adversaries embody a kind of ontological evil. That they are not people. That they are not alive.  
No, they too have stories. Each and every one of them has a reason. They did not suddenly spawn into existence from nowhere. They have motivations, they chose their path.  
   
We all have a story to tell, though some of us may not remember it.  
Saint Sebastian. Tehwo was the one to suggest that name, apparently it once belonged to a holy person of his order, though I have never before heard of them. His is a story I would like to unravel. Perhaps I shall ask him about it when we have more time. But I am trailing off again.  
We found Saint close to the Fauns and Feathers where he crawled out of a gutter. At first I believed him to be no more than an unfortunate victim of a late night drinking spree, yet the symbol he carries has brought with it an unfortunate and, if I may say so, terrifying revelation. Saint is a member of the 4th Circle, carrying the same symbol as all of us, marking him as yet another pawn in the Circles game.  
More importantly is the implication that we are neither the first, nor the only group tasked with investigating all of this.  
Galant has, as expected, not been forthcoming with any information about the matter, which leaves the task of finding out what happened to the rest of Saints group to us.  
His amnesia shows no sign of improving either... if I still had access to the resources and scrolls of my old lab I might have tried to fix his condition, but out here in the wild I can do nothing to help him.  
What is his story? What is his motivation?  
   
As for our investigation... progress has been... slower than I would have wished.  
I will not bore you with the intricacies of all that we have done. Instead I will skip straight to the point.  
Asgorath is involved in this. How exactly, we do not yet know. But we found a letter in his private room. Written in Abyssal.  
The language is that of powerful mages, I still recognize it from my days at the university of Towleigha, though I have never managed to grasp its meaning.  
Galant may be able to translate it however, which is why we are going to seek him out next.  
   
But that is not our only lead. In addition a planned excursion into the sewers of the city in search of Saints remaining group, we will soon travel to the city of Kronwar in search of a person named Savira.  
According to Galant, she has had experience with the monsters we fought. A... concerning piece of information. How many people have suffered this fate I wonder? And when did it start?  
Our travels will take us past Karikko Village. I have never been there before, but if we have the time for it I would like to check up on the safety of its inhabitants.  
   
There is one more story that is worth mentioning in this journal entry.  
That of Malek, Asgoraths runner boy. We have talked to him many times now. He's a good kid, talented, quick on his feet, though his moral code is... questionable.  
I cannot, in good conscience, leave his fate in the hands of Asgorath. I can leave none of the kids fates in the hands of that glorified egomaniac.  
If the guards will not do their job, I will. Malek, Lumi and all the other victims of that wannabe deity deserve that kind of life.  
Asgorath will fall, that I swear. After that the kids will be free to choose their own fate. And who knows, maybe a few of them will decide to join us in our travels.  
I have already made the offer to Malek, perhaps I will extend it to the others as well.  
   
I wonder what kind of story I will find once I turn the page...
