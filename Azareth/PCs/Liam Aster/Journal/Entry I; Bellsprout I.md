It has been a while since I last wrote down anything of note in this journal.  
And to tell the truth, it was not only my infuriating lack of leads, but also the sheer banality of the few pieces of information which I did manage to come across.  
No matter where I went, no matter how many inquiries into the truly staggering amount of missing people I made, I was always confronted by that same air of quiet indifference.  
"All information is with the council," they say, "we keep none of the records here," they spit!  
Wherever I go the people seem to have already forgotten about their missing friends and family and I cannot for the life of me figure out if they are truly filled with such indifference or if they are keeping the truth from me in particular for some reason beyond my understanding!  
And this town seemed to be no different at first.  
Missing people in the dozens, perhaps even in the hundreds and a guard force too incompetent or corrupt to care.  
This city appeared just like all the others.  
Right up until it didn't.  
   
I knew that this city would be different the moment I heard about the fight club.  
Of course other cities also have such things, but this was the first time I've seen one operate on such a public platform. It was a refreshing breath of air.  
Even if I couldn't find any leads on my true target, I might at least be able to uncover or perhaps even stop a different plot.  
But not even in my wildest dreams did I foresee the events that transpired here.  
   
On the morning of my second day here I met some people in the tavern, just as a boy named Malek advertised the local fighting pit.  
Tehwo, a steadfast paladin who follows a God which he refers to as the "Bladesinger". I must confess that I never heard of the name before. Quite the oddity since I always assumed my knowledge of the different faiths to be rather universal. I wonder what else I do not yet know of...  
Aster, a colourfully dressed druid. He sometimes speaks of his wife... I wonder what lead a person like him to the life of a traveller.  
And Keshera, a vagabond with... questionable skills. While she obviously has things in her past that she is running from, it is not my place to pry. We all have something we'd rather leave behind.  
   
We split up again shortly after our first meeting and for a while I began to doubt my reason for being here again.  
The Crownsguard turned out to be just as useless as all the other guards before them. No surprise there, but the ever repeating mention of the council no matter where I go at least confirms my suspicion that this is happening at a larger scale across at least this part of the continent. I still do not trust the council. They seem *too* involved. Less like they're heading an investigation and more like they're attempting a cover-up.  
Their secrecy in this matter does not help to diminish my distrust of them.  
   
But enough of my ramblings the most important part still lies in front of us.  
In the evening my group and I went to the location of the pit fight. A tavern called the "Daring Dragon".  
It is run by a half-Tiefling who goes by the name of "Askorath". Quite the statement of egomania, naming yourself after one of the old dragon gods.  
From what I've gathered, he is an abusive crime lord with an ego to match those of the wealthiest kings and queens.  
I am absolutely sure that he knows something about the events that transpired in his pit during this evenings fight.  
   
The fight started just as one might expect. Keshera and I fought against some other contenders, poor folk who most likely saw this event as a way to quick money.  
But everything changed when Tehwo and Aster entered the pit. Their opponents were obviously sick with something, a fact that should have disqualified them from the match the moment they got here.  
I have no idea how they got past the barkeeper, though my best guess is that they either disposed of him or that he had orders to let them through anyway.  
At any rate, that was the moment I knew that something bad was about to happen. And I was right.  
   
It happened incredibly fast. A slash from Tehwos sword followed by the sounds of cracking bones, stretching skin and bloody breaths. They turned into abominations of muscle and sinew right in front of our eyes.  
But it wasn't just the ones in the pit. It happened all across the stands as well. We did our best to protect the people but I have no way of knowing how many were killed or hurt by the monsters before we managed to put a stop to their rampage.  
I would have liked to begin an investigation right there and then, but the sudden appearance of the Crownsguard put an end to those ambitions of mine.  
   
We were interrogated and detained.  
But that's when *they* appeared. The enforcers. The two members of the Fourth Circle of the Council. Galant and his brute, Revenant.  
Their "timely" appearance is all the proof I need to suspect that they were waiting for this to happen. Maybe not this exact event, but something like it.  
They knew that people were in danger but instead of trying to prevent this attack they let it play out. For what? Information? More leads? I do not know, but I'll be damned if I let them get away with it any for longer than I have to.  
We have entered an... uneasy alliance. We investigate on their behalf now.  
A deal with the devil, I know. But even devils can be outsmarted from time to time.  
And if nothing else, the Councils involvement in this confirms my belief that this event is intrinsically linked to the abductions, and perhaps even to what happen so many months ago in my lab.  
   
For now it is imperative that we find out where the monsters came from and how they are being made.  
I am sure that Askorath and his colleagues will have more information.  
For the first time since I've set out on this journey I have an actual lead... and it's implications scare me. This is much bigger than anything I imagined.  
But I am no longer alone. And I am confident that we will prevail.
