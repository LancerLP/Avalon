### A new addition to the very beginning of the journal.
***
To any who come upon this journal, heed those words written within.
Do not trust the Council.

My name is Liam Aster, a scholar from the University of the Arcane in Towleigha, fourth heir to the Aster family of New Keshaan and, as of late, an unfortunate member of the Council's fourth order.

I travel with Tehwo, the Paladin follower of the Bladesinger, Aster, the travelling Druid, Keshera, the Rogue and Minerva, a fellow researcher of the University.

Should you come upon this book then seek them out. Them, or the King of Keshaan, Aasiren Evander Calistus. They will know what to do.

And watch yourself.

I was right. The Council, or someone high ranking within it, betrayed... everyone.
There is no way to know who did it, or how much of the organisation is aware of it.
It could be an isolated event. Only one person with enough power to keep the others in the dark while their orders are carried out without question... or maybe it's something bigger...
