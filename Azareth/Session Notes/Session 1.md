Currently staying in a West Keshaan village called Bellsprout, the city of taverns. Kleinstadt.

Tavern is called "Fauns and Feathers". Currently renting a room there. Dark, brooding elf at bar (barkeep). Selvira is tavernkeep (Yorna is wife (FAIRY! STAY AWAY!)

Was approached by a cloaked figure covered by many clothes. They asked to sit down at my table.

Person enters bar, astrology symbolism in accessories. Plants incorporated into clothing. Man is wearing very revealing clothing.

Another man in bar with [japanese] clothing style. He is wearing visible armor and he is armed. Not a lot of subtlety, but seems like he doesn't need to rely on that.

Name: Malek Fluffy hair, sun kissed skin, passes flyers around, very anxious. Passing around flyers for another tavern called the "Daring Dragon". Fight event, legal grey area. Reward: 15 GP. Walk to barkeep of Daring Dragon and say that I have: "Treasure to Hoarder"

Guards are abusive (maybe corrupt. Investigate)

Many stores in city center. (Most seem to have set up shop here to have better chances than in the capitals) Many missing person postern. None that Lore knows.

To find out more about the missing people I need to find a member of the 4th Order of the Council (Mind of the council.) They are rather rare. All the information collected by local authorities is sent to the 4th Order. (Weird that they don't keep local records...)

Fight Club Host called the Askorath. Took name of old dragon god. Got a god complex, evidently. Also pays money to the guards. Mix of Tiefling and Dragonborn. Lot's of gold, very rich.

Sick people in the ring. Seems like they only appeared recently after having been missing for a while. (Parasites? Experiments? Mind Control? Investigate.)

People changing into monsters. Very tough, not very resilient. (Transmission? Parasite, Virus, Magic? Investigate.)

Council is involved. (They got here quick. How? Magic?) They sent an investigator and a warrior. 4th Order Galant is the investigator Revenant is the buff one Staying at the "Lavish Eden" inn.

We now work for the council. The amulets they gave us track our position.
