The God of Eternity rising with the Blood Moon to destroy the world is part of an old children's tale.

Documents:
- Most are women and children
- Men are usually under 35 (elves excluded)
- Women can go up to 50-60 yrs old
- More children are women
- Rich ones usually go missing at communal events / in public
- Lots of people from the party went missing
- Furthest back person from around 2.5 years ago.
