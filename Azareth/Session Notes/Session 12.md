Bellsprout was attacked by the same people that attacked the Aster Mansion
No fires were lit
It happened two days ago on the day we left the capital

Someone cast Hunters Mark on Keshera

One of the guards said that they arrived from the north (direction of the capital)
They used rope trick to leave
They used rope trick to arrive
They are in a location with cages

Fauns and Fairies
Dark Puddle of Blood like that from Siren

Attackers teleported into a field.
Walked for 25 minutes
Teleported again

Gallant believes that they might have been looking for us.

"Your tomb shall remain locked."

"Your blood moon will never rise."

"We will not fall."
