We met a person in the gutter. They are a member of the 4th Circle, like us. They do not know their name so we have decided to call them Saint Sebastian, short Saint.

The Daring Dragon is currently filled with guards. Askorath has already left custody. His employees still remain.

Galant and Revenant are on the second floor fourth room on the right. Lavish Eden is run by posh bastards.

Galant Conversation:

- Higher ups don’t give any information to Galant and Revenant either
- Person who has seen the monsters being dead is called Savira und Kronwar
- Kronwar route takes us past Karikko Village

Warden is called Ora.

Barkeep Conversation:

- Didn’t notice the sick people.
- Knows nothing.
- Mentioned Askorath multiple times.

Malek Conversation:

- Lumi was also a runner
- Thinks that Werelizards are involved

Saint has a gold amulet and a runner boy cap

Golden Griffon is where Askorath stays in room 302

Lumi Conversation:

- Lumi was not a runner on that day (she got called off work by Askorath)
- Malek is very shady

Speculation:

- Malek is part of the group that is responsible for everything, using his incompetence to hide his true allegiances
- Askorath’s indifference towards his employees was used by those responsible for the attack
- I need to question Malek without making it suspicious
    - Tell him that I still have some questions for him
    - Tell him that we’ve talked to Askorath and that we are suspecting Lumi
        - Ask him if he knows which taverns she visited yesterday
        - Ask him if he knows why she wasn’t there in the evening
    - Tell him that I can help get him out of here if he helps
    - Tell him that his secret is safe with me

Malek Conversation 2:

- Malek is not involved.
- Possibly recruited Malek to the party

Being strangled gives Keshira PTSD

Askorath has a hidden staircase to a bedroom

We found a letter in abyssal in Asgorath’s room.

Gallant might be able to translate it
