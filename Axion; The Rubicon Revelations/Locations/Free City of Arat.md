The Free City of Arat is the second largest settlement in the Lesser Rubicon, only surpassed by the coastal city of Kor. It was founded 25 years ago by the people of three nomadic tribes, in order to put an end to a generations long conflict.
The three tribes were:
- The Numen
		Mostly made up of Aasimar, Humans, Elves and Surface Dwarves, the Numen, like the Galans claim a heritage in the ancient civilization of Galanor, though they reject this heritage, seeing it as a great shame. Their culture is one of multicultural openness, with an Aasimarii influence. A peculiar fact, since the Aasimar only arrived shortly before the fall of Galanor. Their most revered figure is known as the Golden Angel, a mythical protector that once fought for but then brought the fall of Galanor.
		They commonly dress in yellow and golden clothing with accents of white.
- The Omar
		Humans, Elves, Surface Dwarves and many other species are part of the Omar. They are the only tribe in the city that does not claim a heritage in the civilization of Galanor, instead being immigrants themselves. Their ancestors arrived in the desert around the time of the Great Calamity. What put them into conflict with the other tribes was their religious fascination with the Inbetween, which they call "The Prismatic Realm". 
		Omar can be distinguished by their tattoos, which depict prismatic scenes of flowing colours.
- The Galans
		The Galans are a tribe of humans and half-humans. They proudly trace their ancestry back to the ancient civilization of Galanor. They are weary of outsiders and detest the Numen for their reverence of the Golden Angel, a figure they instead call the Great Destroyer. 
		Galans have a deep rooted martial culture, leading to them wearing pieces of armour around the clock. Most are armed.
While the conflict of old has been quelled by this alliance, tensions are still strained between the members of the three tribes. The arrival of Expeditions from Lanmoth has put further pressure on the city. Some factions seek to drive out the Outlanders, while others see them as a useful tool to further their political aspirations.

Some of the younger members of the city are already of mixed descent, having parents from two tribes. The oldest mixed local is a 22 year old woman named Sadie. Her father was a Galan, while her mother was a Numen. She hopes that the two tribes can one day put their differences aside and work together. To achieve this, she works close with the Expedition, hoping that they can find something in their travels that can help ease tensions between the two tribes.
### Locations:
***
#### Political:
***
###### The Hall of Elders:
The Hall of Elders sits at the very centre of Arat. Here, the cities leaders come together to decide on the important topics of running the city. Traditionally, there exist three Elders, each one a member of one of the different tribes. Below them exists the city council, made up of representatives from each part of the city and from each field of work.

#### Social:
***
###### Il Taveriana (The Waterhole):
The first place where travellers go when they arrive in the city. Not really frequented by many of the locals, this establishment is one of the few places that sells food and drink not usually found in the desert. 

#### Quest:
****
###### Expedition Headquarters:
A medium sized building provided by the city to the Expedition. It contains a few rooms for those adventurers that stay in the city for longer periods of time. In addition to that it contains ample storage space and rooms filled with maps, scrolls and tables large enough for strategic planning.

#### Economic:
***
###### The Workshop:
An amalgamation of multiple artisanal shops and establishments located in the inner western part of the city. A large courtyard combines all the workshops while palm trees and fabric sails provide shade. Windmills on the roofs provide kinetic energy to the workshops.
The workshops contained within this structure are: A smithy, a leatherworker, a fletcher, a carpenter, a pottery, a cobbler, a glassblower, a mason, a weaver, a woodcarver and a tinkerer.

###### The Arcanist:
A small shop located in the inner eastern part of the city. Hidden in the denser urban sprawl beneath fabrics and buildings, lies this cool and dusky shop. Here, special potions are brewed and exotic resources are created. Some even claim that magical enchantments can be created by the owner, if she is willing.

###### Caravan's Rest:
Both a location as well as a shop in the outer southern part of the city, Caravan's Rest is the location where travelling caravans and salespeople set up shop. While each of the caravans has their own small stands to sell goods at, there is nonetheless a single permanent shop sharing the same name as the location where goods, gathered from all the caravans are sold. Ease of use. For a small fee.

#### Religious:
***
###### Angel's Rest:
A holy place for the Numen, located in the central north of the city. Angel's Rest is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Decades ago it was a tavern for travellers and those who were still settling the area. Early on in the cities history, it is said that a great monster threatened the city, but an outsider who stayed here slew the beast. The Numen elders believed the outsider to be an avatar of the Golden Angel, turning the once tavern into a temple.

###### The Prismatic Temple:
Located on the north-western fringes of the city, the Omar call this place their sanctuary. It is a haven for all those who wish to flee from the scorching heat. Large pillars of magical ice cool down the rooms, and glass windows focus the light into enthralling prismatic plays on every wall.
