Session 2 consists of two major events as well as two sidequest events and four optional events.

The first major event happens at the beginning of the session. It deals with the parties arrival at the city and contains their exploration of it.
During that event the party will be able to pick up two sidequests as well as their next step in the main quest.

The second major event happens if they follow the main quest. Around half-way through their journey towards the specified location they will encounter the remains of a dead expedition member. It appears as though he was crushed after his horse died and, unable to escape from underneath the corpse, eventually succumbed to the deserts heat and lack of water.
Once the party arrives at the location they will see a pack of Hyenas ripping apart the corpse of another expedition member. Dispatching of or scaring off the Hyenas will allow them to investigate the campsite. There are signs of a fight here, though a short one. Investigating the corpse reveals that he has wounds in multiple non-critical areas. Broken wrists and ankles. He was then tied to a pole where he was eventually found by the Hyenas and torn apart.
Close to the campsite is a ruin, exploring it will reveal a dig site leading further down into the earth. Eventually ending in a larger hall containing a large ornate door of Aasimar design. Tied up, gagged and blindfolded close to it is another member of the expedition. It is not hard to see the large amount of explosives all around the room. Soon after Moses will enter the room from an elevated part of the room and confront the party.

The first sidequest is given to the party by Lyonell Strauss, the cities main doctor. A shipment of medicine that he was expecting hasn't arrived together with multiple other caravans. He would have put assumed them lost to animals or the weather had he not received a message from one of his associates on the caravan. It seems like they have been held up at an old gate ruin to the south west of the city. Strauss wants the party to investigate and bring back any supplies they find.

The second sidequest can be encountered if the party triggers the ghost wagon event again, but this time follows it to its destination. It will lead them to an abandoned mine in the mountains to the north of the city. They will find the remains of a wagon and its occupants there together with a rift to the inbetween. Once they enter that part of the mine they will have 120 seconds to loot the place before creatures of the Inbetween start emerging from the rift. 

Four optional events exist:
Caravan
- The party encounters a caravan on its way to the city. They can barter with it for a discount.

Bandits
- The party runs into a group of bandits. A fight most likely ensues.

Oasis
- The party encounters a shifting oasis. The entire place reeks of magic, but just being here is calming. Maybe asking the city folk about this will help?

Nomad
- The party encounters the moving hut of a nomad. He can tell them stories or give them pointers. If the party can convince him, he might even part with some of his supplies.
