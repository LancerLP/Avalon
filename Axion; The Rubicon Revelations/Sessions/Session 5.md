Session begins with the party entering Dr. Strauss' clinic. There, they will learn that no more caravans will arrive because the route has gotten way too dangerous to the point where even the experienced caravans won't risk it anymore.

### Arden Belros head:
Amaris wanted to cast speak with the dead on Arden Belros' head. The man clawed his own eyes out after he destroyed a bunch of ancient murals.
The full passage that Arden destroyed translates to the following:
Let those who stride in these halls walk in Remembrance
for the Calamity that followed us here cut away all else that remained of us.
Shattering not just our cradle but also this new home in the process. 
And even though we undertook the greatest Sacrifice, it can only be halted for so long.

If asked about what he saw that led him to kill himself, Arden will respond by saying 
"It was… it was in my mind! Always there—watching, crawling closer! I tried to look away, but it… it wouldn’t stop! No escape… no hiding… gods I CAN STILL SEE IT! GET IT AWAY FROM ME! GET IT AWAY!"

If pressed on the topic he will shout
"IT WAS IN THE WORDS! HIDDEN! TRAPPED! GET IT AWAY FROM MEEEEEEEE!"

### The First Outpost:
Selene will tell the party that things seem pretty cramped in the city with so many people around.
She looked into some of the reports from the scouting groups and believes that it's time to expand the expeditions reach again.
She gives the party two locations that seem promising as outpost sites but tells them that the decision is ultimately up to them if they find any location that would be even better.

#### Site 1: Abandoned Mine
An abandoned mine ~20 hours away from the city on foot.
Claiming it would give the expedition a steady supply of metals both common and rare.
The expedition itself doesn't have any members skilled in ore extraction but maybe the artisans guild of Arat can help with that problem. Selene will advise the party to talk to a woman named Sadie if they decide to build the outpost there.
Scout groups have however reported that the ghost wagon spotted by multiple expedition members seemed to travel in that direction.

#### Site 2: Healing Springs
This is an old spot that the first expedition tried to occupy. The waters have healing properties that are nothing short of magical. Even comparable to some lesser healing potions.
The team that was sent there during the time of the first expedition vanished, never to be seen again. By that time in the expedition, sending anyone to investigate was no longer an option. Maybe the party can finally figure out what happened?

#### Site 3: The South Gate
Mentioned by Lyonell Strauss, while the South Gate is still very close to the city and therefor won't offer many advantages when it comes to exploring the desert, occupying it would be relatively easy. Buildings still exist and could be repaired without much effort. And the gates location would greatly increase the safety of local trade routes. Stationing adventurers there might even help them track down where the bandits are coming from.

### The B-Team:
With the arrival of more adventurers drawing ever nearer, Ward decides it's the right time to hand command of some teams off to other more experienced adventurers. He thinks that the party is ready to handle command of such a team. The team consists of:

#### Karra Arran - Galan Tracker - Aasimar
Karra is the team’s desert native, a skilled tracker and fighter descending from the ranks of the Galans. She’s well-versed in desert survival, understanding the ways of sandstorms, hidden water sources, and desert creatures. While she’s familiar with her home terrain, she hasn’t had much experience outside of it and is excited to meet people from other parts of the world.
She tried leaving the desert in the past by stowing away on a Lanmothian frigate. She was caught and imprisoned.

##### Appearance:
Silver-white hair put together in a bun. 
Silver eyes.
Dark scale mail armor with red fabric. Looks airy and light.

#### Alden Thornbrook - Knight Errant - Human
Hailing from the coastal republic of Albion, Alden once trained as a knight but left before becoming fully initiated. He’s familiar with weaponry and has some formal combat training, but his skills are rough around the edges. He joined the expedition voluntarily to redeem himself after a fallout with his noble family, and he’s eager to put his training to use.

##### Appearance:
Short brown hair and a clean shave.
Hazel eyes.
Reinforced leather armor with small metal plates covering vital spots.

#### Darla Finnick - Foreign Rogue - Gnome
Darla grew up in the bustling, crime-ridden port city of Grenhaven. With a talent for sleight of hand, she got by as a pickpocket and smuggler before she pickpocketed the wrong Lanmothian noble. She joining the expedition to get out of prison. The desert is new and intimidating for her, but her resourcefulness makes her adaptable.

##### Appearance:
Short spiky blonde hair.

#### Yara Sorrel - Travelling Herbalist - Halfling
Yara hails from Aucourt, where she worked as an herbalist’s apprentice before setting off as a traveling apothecary. She has extensive knowledge of herbs, potions, and minor healing techniques but isn’t familiar with desert plants or remedies. She was forced to join the expedition after she was accused of stealing rare flowers from a royal garden in Lanmoth, a deed which she denies. Now she states that at least she'll be able to learn about new regions and expand her medicinal knowledge by being here.

##### Appearance:
Flowing light brown hair.
Blue eyes.
Light clothes and pieces of dried wood in pace of traditional armor.
A staff.

#### Flint Marrowe - Freelance Archeologist - Half Elf
Flint is a born and raised Lamellian. The many caves and ruins in his home nation fueled his interest in history and artifacts. Self-trained in archaeology, he joined the expedition to uncover relics and lore from the desert’s past. Though not a fighter, he’s skilled in excavation and deciphering old symbols, which has proven useful in navigating ruins and ancient sites.
His knowledge of the Arcane and his short stint with the Doctors of Mercy makes him a valuable asset.

##### Appearance:
Long and woven black hair.
Golden eyes.
Adventuring gear with many pouches. 
Wand.
