This session mainly contains the unobtained random encounters from Session 2 as well as the dig site.
The dig site is a small dungeon with the following parts:

### **The Ancient Dig Site**

The dig site lies half-buried in the ever-shifting sands of the Lesser Rubicon Desert, a testament to the ancient civilization that once thrived here. This place is eerily quiet, the wind howling through broken stone arches and cracked columns, carrying with it the weight of time and forgotten history.

#### **Surface Level (Main Camp)**

As the party approaches the surface level, they find the remnants of the expedition camp—a collection of tattered tents and abandoned equipment, all scattered across the entrance to a long-forgotten ruin. A rickety **wooden lift** stands at the center, attached to a series of frayed ropes and pulleys that descend into the depths below. The lift creaks ominously, swaying in the wind. Its old boards groan underfoot as the party steps on, and as they descend, a jarring jolt halfway down causes the lift to jam momentarily, making the group fear it might snap.

**Potential Loot**:

- **Expedition Map Case**: Contains rough maps of the surrounding desert and some sections of the dig site, potentially providing useful hints for future exploration.
- **Alchemical Healing Potions**: Basic potions (1d4 found), capable of healing 2d4+2 HP each.
- **Rations & Water Skins**: Useful for survival, especially in the harsh desert environment.
- **Weathered Compass**: Always points toward Arat, with faint traces of magical runes, though their power has long faded.

#### **First Level (Exploration Chambers)**

The first level of the ruins consists of partially excavated chambers, with half-buried halls and corridors leading into the depths. The walls here are carved with **faint constellations**, worn down by time but still recognizable. Occasionally, small piles of sand shift and spill through cracks in the stone, adding to the eerie stillness of the place.

As the party explores, they come across **scattered belongings** from the expedition: torn packs, broken tools, and journals left behind in the rush to flee or fight. **Signs of a struggle** are everywhere—overturned crates, cracked weapons, and dark stains on the floor hinting at a deadly encounter. The air feels thick, as if something is watching, waiting.

**Dynamic Elements**:

- **Creaking Ceilings and Shifting Sand**: Occasional cracks in the ceiling drop sand, and the wind howls through hidden passages, creating an unsettling atmosphere.
- **Falling Debris**: Players may need to dodge small stones or debris from the crumbling structure as they move deeper, building tension.

**Potential Loot**:

- **Ancient Sandstone Amulet**: A simple amulet with faint runes granting advantage on Constitution saving throws against exhaustion from heat.
- **Scroll of Detect Magic**: Found among the dead expedition members’ belongings, this scroll allows the party to use _Detect Magic_ once.
- **Mummified Hand of Guidance**: Grants the user the ability to cast _Guidance_ once per short rest.
- **Cracked Mirror of Reflections**: A small mirror that reveals the image of the last person who touched it, usable once per day.

#### **Second Level (The Hidden Sanctum)**

Deeper down, the architecture changes. The chambers on the second level are larger, more grandiose, with carvings and murals depicting ancient battles and celestial beings. One wall holds a faded mural showing a great conflict, perhaps foreshadowing what is sealed deeper within the Greater Rubicon. Parts of the mural are damaged, but the remnants tell of a people defending themselves against an unknown, terrifying force.

Here, the faint glow of **crystals embedded in the walls** flickers occasionally, casting long, eerie shadows that dance across the stone floor. The deeper the party goes, the more frequent the **small tremors** become, as if something stirs below.

**Dynamic Elements**:

- **Collapsing Pathways**: Some of the stone bridges or corridors are unstable, forcing the players to navigate carefully or risk falling.
- **Shifting Lights**: The magical crystals in the walls pulse irregularly, adding to the tension.

**Potential Loot**:

- **Scroll of False Life**: Grants temporary hit points when used.
- **Dust of Dryness**: Absorbs up to 15 feet of water into a small pellet, which can later release the liquid.
- **Ring of the Desert Wanderer**: Grants advantage on saving throws against becoming lost in the desert and allows the wearer to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand.
- **Ancient Sword Fragment**: A broken short sword with a +1 to attack rolls, but it only deals 1d4 damage. Its constellations hint at a deeper significance.

#### **Third Level (The Sealed Door)**

The third and final level leads to a vast chamber, where the **Sealed Door** stands ominously at the far end. The door is a massive slab of stone, etched with more celestial symbols and constellations, clearly ancient and magical in nature. It hums faintly with a power long forgotten, but the way forward is blocked by this door, which requires three ancient artifacts—a sword, a crown, and a lute—to open.

**Dynamic Elements**:

- **Runes of Power**: Faint, glowing runes in the door pulse with an ancient magic that resonates through the room.
- **Signs of Moses**: Footprints in the dust and a few scattered belongings of Moses hint at his recent presence, perhaps taunting the party.

**Potential Loot**:

- **Runestone of Warding**: Creates a protective ward that grants +1 AC in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute, usable once per day.
- **Scroll of Comprehend Languages**: Allows the user to understand ancient writing on the door or murals.
- **Veil of Lost Whispers**: A cursed item allowing the wearer to cast _Message_ once per day, but with a chance of hearing unsettling whispers.
- **Bronze Key of the Forgotten**: A magical key that can unlock any mundane lock once per day, though it risks sealing the lock permanently instead.

#### **First Level – Galen’s Journal (Near His Body)**

Galen’s journal can be found tucked into his cloak near the collapsed corridor where his body lies, pinned under some rubble.

**Entry 1 (Day 3)**: _“The desert’s been kind to us so far, but Selene’s pushing hard. She wants answers, and fast. This ruin… it’s different. There’s something in the air here, something that feels old and angry. I’ll have to stay sharp.”_
    
**Entry 2 (Day 4)**: _“We found some strange inscriptions today. Arden says they’re from the old civilization we’re looking for. There’s something about the way they’re carved… I don’t like it.”_
    
**Final Entry (Day 7)**: _“There’s been movement. Strange sounds, shadows where there shouldn’t be any. Selene says we’ll press on, but I think we’ve gone too far. Whatever’s down here doesn’t want us here. I can feel it.”_
    

#### **Second Level – Dr. Arden’s Journal (Near the Mural)**

Arden’s journal is found next to his body, along with a collection of his translation notes on a nearby mural.

**Entry 1 (Day 4)**: _“We’ve encountered murals depicting ancient battles. The imagery is… disturbing. It seems to depict celestial entities and an overwhelming force that sought to consume them. Selene believes this is tied to the Greater Rubicon, but I’m not so sure. The language is old, but I’m starting to make progress.”_
    
**Entry 2 (Day 6)**: _“Today, I translated a warning. ‘Those who pass beyond the stars will face the judgment of the lost.’ Selene doesn’t believe it’s literal, but there’s a chill in the air that suggests otherwise. I’ve advised caution, though I doubt she’ll listen.”_
    
**Final Entry (Day 7)**: _“We’re not alone. I can see it in the carvings now, something is coming for us. We found a door, deeper down. We need to leave, but Selene insists we open it. I only hope we make it back to warn the others.”_
    

#### **Third Level – Captain Selene’s Journal (Near the Sealed Door)**

Selene’s journal can be found close to her remains at the Sealed Door. Her final entries reveal her determination, though they grow increasingly desperate as they near the end.

**Entry 1 (Day 1)**: _“We’ve set up camp at the site. The team seems in good spirits, though Nara has had trouble with the lift. I can’t shake the feeling we’re on the verge of something big. If this ruin holds the key to the old civilization’s secrets.”_
    
**Entry 2 (Day 5)**: _“Arden’s had some success with the translations. Galen’s been hearing things, but I think it’s just nerves. I’ll admit, the atmosphere here is oppressive, but we can’t turn back now.”_

**Entry 3 (Day 9)**: _"I've barricaded the entrance to this room but I don't think it will hold. I can only hope that Ward sends someone before it's too late."_


#### **Surface Level – Nara’s Notes (Found Near the Lift)**

Nara’s journal is half-scattered around the entrance near the lift. There’s a mix of hastily scribbled plans and mechanical notes regarding the excavation.

**Entry 1 (Day 2)**: _“The lift’s rigging is in worse shape than I thought. We’ll need to reinforce it if we’re going to keep going down. The whole place feels like it could collapse at any minute, but that’s what makes it exciting! This old tech could teach us so much if we just had time to study it.”_
    
**Entry 2 (Day 7)**: _“Selene says there’s something important beyond that door. I’ve been trying to figure out how the locking mechanism works, but it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’ll need more time, though Selene is rushing us.”_
    
**Final Entry (Day 8)**: _“Something’s wrong. I heard a scream earlier—Galen? Arden? I didn’t wait to find out. I’m getting out of here. Nyven Ross made it out... I'll follow his tracks… I don’t want to die here.”_
