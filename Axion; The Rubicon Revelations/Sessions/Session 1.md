# Chains of an Empire

### Session Opening Cinematic
---

We write the year 502 of the Second Era—and the world is burning.

Venerable kingdoms, bastions of antiquity, now crumble like sandcastles beneath the relentless tide. Millennia of history dissolve into whispers as once vibrant cultures fade into the abyss of oblivion, leaving naught but echoes of forgotten splendor.

The dwarves, heirs to the depths, retreat to their grand Thaigs, seeking solace in the earth's embrace. Meanwhile, the elves, guardians of ancient gateways, cling to the remnants of their ancestral home, in a desperate struggle against the encroaching shadows.

Amidst this tempest of destruction, the great ziggurats and cities of the Rubicon stand as bastions of defiance, their resilience a testament to the indomitable spirit of mortal resolve. But even their steadfast walls quake with the ominous portent of impending doom.

In this crucible of turmoil, a lone figure emerges, adorned in resplendent armor of white gold, bearing the weight of sovereignty upon a troubled brow. His gaze surveys the desolation, where once proud fields now lie scorched and once majestic edifices crumble to dust.

The streets run red with the blood of his kin, while mages, their powers aflame, wage a futile war against the encroaching darkness that engulfs the heavens. Desperation hangs heavy in the air, a palpable miasma of impending doom.

A touch upon his shoulder breaks the silence, a gesture of camaraderie in the face of overwhelming despair. Yet, in the depths of their eyes, once ablaze with shared purpose, now flickers only the specter of defeat—a silent lament for the cycle of suffering that knows no end.

With a solemn nod, the monarch clad in gold issues his final decree, a beacon of fleeting tranquility amidst the storm. And for a fleeting moment, the world holds its breath, suspended in a fragile truce.

We write the year 502 of the Second Era, as the curtain falls upon the stage of history, the world succumbs to the inevitable embrace of oblivion, consumed by a blinding conflagration that heralds the end of all things.

### Scene: The Courtroom

SCENE CINEMATIC:

We write the year 215 of the Third Era and three figures are once again escorted through the obsidian halls in which they were sentenced for crimes, not a week prior.
A hot gust of air emerges from the large doors to the court room as they are slowly opened.
The last time you were here, a tribunal of noble Genasi let judgement descend upon you, but this time, the large room with its podiums and rows of seats is empty, save for a lone figure, casually resting in the seat reserved for the head judge. His legs crossed, hands clasped together, a smirk on his face. With a wave of his right hand the guards exit the room, leaving you alone with the figure. "I apologise for having you dragged out of your cells at such a late time... you are those that I requested, correct? Mr. O'Ronnel, Amaris, Revaire...?"
