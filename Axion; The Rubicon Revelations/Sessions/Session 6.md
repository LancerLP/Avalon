## High Priestess Ilyana
Ilyana is a female Drow, clad in a shimmering dress with a beautiful head piece and veil that seems to fracture and reflect the light. Her body is covered in intricate patterns of colorful tattoos. 
As a child, she traveled with a caravan which was attacked by creatures from the Inbetween and sucked into the alien dimension. But while everyone else died, Ilyana survived and when the screams and fading echos of her companions and parents faded, what was left behind was a beautiful realm of flowing colors where no sadness could exist. She met her patron there, a being in the form of an Owl who guided her through it and bestowed wisdom upon her. She eventually left the Inbetween and joined the first Omar who arrived. She calls her patron the Wanderer. 

Ilyana is deeply mystical, calm, and thoughtful. She carries an aura of mystery, often speaking in riddles and cryptic phrases that reflect her profound connection to the Inbetween.

Ilyana is a spiritual leader and a guide to those who seek enlightenment. She leads the more meditative and mystical aspects of the Omar faith, guiding initiates through visions and dream journeys that are supposed to connect them with the Inbetween.

Ilyana would view the Interstone as a sacred sign, one that indicates the player has been chosen to undergo a transformation. She would speak to them in spiritual terms, inviting them to embrace the rock as part of their own journey toward enlightenment. Ilyana is unlikely to push the player forcefully, instead, she would offer them a vision of what they could become if they surrender themselves to the Inbetween. If the player resists, Ilyana might offer to guide them through a dream journey, hoping to convince them to accept their fate.

If the player approaches Ilyana, she might offer them a calming, otherworldly experience through visions or dreams. She might talk about the path of transcendence that the Interstone offers, explaining how it connects them to the higher spiritual planes. Ilyana would not force the player, but rather invite them to see the rock as part of their spiritual awakening. If the player is resistant, she might speak cryptically about the "greater path" they cannot yet understand, leaving them to question whether they are truly ready to face the Inbetween.

## The Scratching Horror

The player lies in bed, engulfed in a heavy silence. The air feels thick, almost suffocating, and the shadows in the room seem to pulse with a life of their own, shifting and writhing in the corners of their vision.

A faint _scratching_ echoes from the walls, a low, rhythmic sound that burrows into their mind. It grows louder, more insistent, each scrape resonating with a primal fear that claws at their sanity. The scratching is accompanied by a subtle shift in the shadows, something _moving_ just beyond the edge of perception.

The darkness thickens, coiling around the edges of the room as a shape emerges—a twisted, hunched figure that crawls forward with an unsettling grace. Its limbs contort unnaturally, bones cracking and shifting as it moves, a grotesque parody of a living being. Its movements are deliberately slow, savoring the moment, relishing the terror it instills.

The player feels a suffocating weight settle over them, an oppressive presence that invades their very thoughts. The creature approaches, drawing closer, its form obscured in the thick shadows. The feeling of being watched intensifies, a primal instinct screaming that something is very, very wrong.

As it inches nearer, the room warps around the player, walls stretching and bending under the pressure of unseen dread. The creature pauses, its posture low and predatory, as if toying with its prey. It seems to relish in the player’s rising panic, the way their heart races and breath quickens.

With every scratching sound, the shadows seem to pulse, throbbing with an unsettling energy. The player’s surroundings blur as flashes of their deepest fears flicker in and out of focus—a loved one’s scream, a moment of failure, the sensation of being utterly alone. The creature’s form seems to dance in the darkness, delighting in the chaos it has summoned.

Just as the player feels they might break under the weight of fear, the nightmare shifts, and they awake suddenly in their bed, gasping for air. The remnants of terror cling to them, suffocating and palpable. Though the room is unchanged, a lingering sense of dread fills the air, a reminder that the creature is still there—hiding in the shadows of their mind, waiting for the next opportunity to strike.

## The Abandoned Mine
The mine was abandoned a decade ago when the workers blasted their way into an old ruin overrun by creatures from the Inbetween. Their exposure to the Inbetween infected most of them with Interstone and they died in the mines. But not before they managed to seal the deeper parts of the mine again. What is left on the surface are the bodies of a great many miners as well as a captured creature from the Inbetween buried there for a decade. The creature will control the Interstone and revive the skeletons over and over again until it is killed.

## The B-Team
The B-Team will take roughly a week to find a bandit outpost in the desert.
Their time table will be the following:

Day 1:
Imminent arrival at the South Gate

Day 2:
Arrival at the South Gate, skirmish with some bandits. Prisoner taken. Interrogating.

Day 3:
Following trade route. Came across remains of a caravan. Old. Well scavenged.

Day 4:
Scouting surrounding area. No luck.

Day 5:
Managed to hide from bandit patrol. Waiting for them to return and trail them.

Day 6: 
Bandits returned. Started trailing them.

Day 7:
Found large group of bandits. At least 20 at any given time. They seem to have an arena of some sorts set up in the middle of their camp.
Don't seem immediately hostile to outsiders from the look of things.
